# TODO

- Smooth animation start (with easing)
- player controls (stop, pause, time travel)
- perf opt: use cache for init data (like precomputed partitions array in TILES)
- next/prev animation modal (using keyboard arrows)
- position of preview fragment (in px)
- make animations independent from canvas size (?)
- worm like transition of site header when scrolling down
- thread: make multiple threads in sync but with x-axis shift and color shift
- presets for params (with gradual transition)
- more advanced controls: transformers, l/r arrows
